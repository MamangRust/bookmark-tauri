Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley. It is intended to be a successor to the C programming language, with the goals of being even smaller and simpler to program in while also offering modern features, new optimizations and a variety of safety mechanisms while not as demanding of runtime safety as seen in other languages.[3] It is distinct from languages like Go, Rust and Carbon, which have similar goals but also target the C++ space.[4][5][6]
